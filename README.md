# Docker Base

Docker Base is a collection of Docker and Docker Compose files used to quickly spin up a development container. Looking for a way to keep your project code and dependencies separate from your host machine? Want something to base your Github Codespace or Gitpod containers off of? This repository might serve as a good starting point.

## Configuration

Development dependencies can be found in the `Dockerfile` for each respective development environment. Programming language specific containers extend a base container running Ubuntu LTS. Just about everything else can be found and configured in the respective `docker-compose.yaml` files.
